## Meaning of HTML

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language.** It is the standard markup language used for creating and designing documents on the World Wide Web. Here are some key points about HTML:

### Structure: 
HTML provides the basic structure of web pages by using a variety of elements or tags. These tags define different parts of the content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia.

### Hypertext: 
The "HyperText" part of HTML refers to the ability to create links (hyperlinks) that connect different documents or parts of a document. This is a fundamental feature that allows users to navigate between web pages.

### Markup Language: 
As a markup language, HTML uses a set of markup tags to describe the content and structure of a web page. These tags are usually enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <tag>).

### Elements and Attributes: 
HTML elements are composed of a start tag, content, and an end tag. Some tags are self-closing. Elements can also have attributes, which provide additional information about the element.

### Versioning: 
HTML has undergone several revisions since its inception. The latest version is HTML5, which introduces new elements, attributes, and behaviors, as well as improved support for multimedia and graphical content.

HTML is a foundational technology for building web pages and web applications, working in conjunction with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create rich, interactive web experiences.

## Where does markup come from

The term **"markup"** in HTML originates from the traditional publishing practice where editors marked up manuscripts with instructions for typesetters. In the digital realm, HTML uses similar markup tags to structure and format web documents, guiding browsers on how to display content. This practice allows for the separation of content from presentation and ensures consistent rendering across different platforms.

## Syntax and Semantics

**Syntax and semantics** are fundamental concepts in both programming languages and natural languages, each playing a distinct role.

### Syntax
- **Definition:** Syntax refers to the set of rules that define the structure and arrangement of symbols in a language. It dictates how elements should be   combined to form valid sentences or statements.

- **Example in Programming:** In HTML, syntax rules dictate that a paragraph element must start with <p> and end with </p>.
Importance: Ensures that the code is correctly structured so that it can be parsed and understood by the compiler or interpreter.

### Semantics
- **Definition:** Semantics deals with the meaning behind the symbols, expressions, or statements within a language. It focuses on what the constructs represent and how they behave.

- **Example in Programming:** In HTML, the semantics of the <p> tag is that it denotes a paragraph, instructing the browser to display the enclosed text as a paragraph.

- **Importance:** Ensures that the code behaves as intended and that the instructions produce the correct outcome or convey the correct message.
Recognizing the Difference


### In summary:

**Syntax:** How the code is written.

**Semantics:** What the code means.
